# Hydro Automation Collaboration

This semester I worked on the second revision of Hydro's Automation Architecture. I worked mainly with 1 peer collaborator and a group of ~5 first years/sophomores on this development. Working in a group of this size required deliberate processes to encourage productive collaboration; below are the processes and resources created to facilitate this.


## Team Values

We created a document that contained the values we hope to embody in the team. The values and their description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OJNvd0kenk9DHmTYejzCaRjYyAjlhd418WMiSivKus/edit). We presented these values to the team and accepted any feedback or changes that members wanted to add.

I also gave a presentation to the entire PiNT organization to explain how Hydro thinks about their impact as an organization. This was intended to help give each team member agency and motivation to explore their interests freely. This presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-0RsYcsTI9V0iFOwBBgDNXiJhX1RRLCftFCTicgvpvw/edit?usp=sharing). 


## Facilitating Knowledge Transfer

As there were many members of the automation team that did not have experience writing software, I took time to explain many of the concepts and tools that we are using. I gave tutorials/demos on how to use github, how to set up platformio, how to interact with our graphql API. For some of these tutorials and demos I created references to go along with them [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pWJFK-0sHZhJPD8K4xb3IIYOxR7ymnW-). Hydro also has an onboarding document that was created in the past that I updated with more up to date and relevant information [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pWJFK-0sHZhJPD8K4xb3IIYOxR7ymnW-). All of these resources were used and created to help new and current members get up to speed with our new architecture and design.


## Code Review

We set up our Data API and Mother Nature repositories to require reviews before merging into main.

My code reviewed:
- https://github.com/Olin-Hydro/mother-nature/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed  

Reviewing others code:
- https://github.com/Olin-Hydro/hydrangea/pull/14
- https://github.com/Olin-Hydro/hydrangea/pull/7
- https://github.com/Olin-Hydro/hydrangea/pull/10
- https://github.com/Olin-Hydro/hydrangea/pull/16


Code review allowed our team to stay up to date on the progress in each project as well as get valuable feedback.

## Conclusion
The above work demonstrates my ability to document team values, facilitate knowledge transfer and review code.
